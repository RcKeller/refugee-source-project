# Refugee Resource Project
(someone come up with a better title!)

Our goal - reverse the process related to gathering information about refugee services in the State of Washington.
* Instead of having users reach *out* for information - learn about the user. Bring the information to them
* Reduce information overload. Bring jargon to plain language. Have TL;DR's and accessible language.
* Develop a taxonomy for refugee resources, turn it into a services directory, and provide the user with "just enough" of a view that is relevant for their situation.
